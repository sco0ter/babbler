/**
 * The implementation of the {@code <connection-timeout/>} stream error.
 * <blockquote>
 * <p><cite><a href="http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6120.html#streams-error-conditions-connection-timeout">4.9.3.4.  connection-timeout</a></cite></p>
 * <p>One party is closing the stream because it has reason to believe that the other party has permanently lost the ability to communicate over the stream. The lack of ability to communicate can be discovered using various methods, such as whitespace keepalives as specified under Section 4.4, XMPP-level pings as defined in [XEP-0199], and XMPP Stream Management as defined in [XEP-0198].</p>
