/**
 * Provides XML schema implementations of <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0261.html">XEP-0261: Jingle In-Band Bytestreams Transport Method</a>.
 * <p>
 * It defines a Jingle transport method that results in sending data via the In-Band Bytestreams (IBB) protocol defined in XEP-0047. Essentially this transport method reuses XEP-0047 semantics for sending the data and defines native Jingle methods for starting and ending an IBB session.
