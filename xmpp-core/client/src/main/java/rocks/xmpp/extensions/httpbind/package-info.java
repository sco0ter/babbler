/**
 * Provides classes for <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html">XEP-0124: Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH)</a> and <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0206.html">XEP-0206: XMPP Over BOSH</a>.
 * <p>
 * XEP-124 defines a transport protocol that emulates the semantics of a long-lived, bidirectional TCP connection between two entities (such as a client and a server) by efficiently using multiple synchronous HTTP request/response pairs without requiring the use of frequent polling or chunked responses.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * XEP-206 defines how the Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH) technology can be used to transport XMPP stanzas. The result is an HTTP binding for XMPP communications that is useful in situations where a device or client is unable to maintain a long-lived TCP connection to an XMPP server.
