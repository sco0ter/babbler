 * <p>The requesting entity is not authorized to access the requested service because prior registration is necessary (examples of prior registration include members-only rooms in XMPP multi-user chat [XEP-0045] and gateways to non-XMPP instant messaging services, which traditionally required registration in order to use the gateway [XEP-0100]); the associated error type SHOULD be "auth".</p>
