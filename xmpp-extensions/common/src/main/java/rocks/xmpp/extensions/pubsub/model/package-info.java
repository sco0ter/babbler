/**
 * Provides XML schema implementations and configuration classes for <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html">XEP-0060:
 * Publish-Subscribe</a>.
 *
 * <p>It defines an XMPP protocol extension for generic publish-subscribe functionality. The protocol enables XMPP
 * entities to create nodes (topics) at a pubsub service and publish information at those nodes; an event notification
 * (with or without payload) is then broadcasted to all entities that have subscribed to the node. Pubsub therefore
 * adheres to the classic Observer design pattern and can serve as the foundation for a wide variety of applications,
 * including news feeds, content syndication, rich presence, geolocation, workflow systems, network management systems,
 * and any other application that requires event notifications.</p>
