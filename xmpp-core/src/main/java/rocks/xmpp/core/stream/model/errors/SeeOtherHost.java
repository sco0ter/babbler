/**
 * The implementation of the {@code <see-other-host/>} stream error.
 * <blockquote>
 * <p><cite><a href="http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6120.html#streams-error-conditions-see-other-host">4.9.3.19.  see-other-host</a></cite></p>
 * <p>The server will not provide service to the initiating entity but is redirecting traffic to another host under the administrative control of the same service provider. The XML character data of the {@code <see-other-host/>} element returned by the server MUST specify the alternate FQDN or IP address at which to connect, which MUST be a valid domainpart or a domainpart plus port number (separated by the ':' character in the form "domainpart:port"). If the domainpart is the same as the source domain, derived domain, or resolved IPv4 or IPv6 address to which the initiating entity originally connected (differing only by the port number), then the initiating entity SHOULD simply attempt to reconnect at that address. (The format of an IPv6 address MUST follow [IPv6-ADDR], which includes the enclosing the IPv6 address in square brackets '[' and ']' as originally defined by [URI].) Otherwise, the initiating entity MUST resolve the FQDN specified in the {@code <see-other-host/>} element as described under Section 3.2.</p>
