/**
 * Provides classes for <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0138.html">XEP-0138: Stream Compression</a>.
 * <p>
 * It defines an XMPP protocol extension for negotiating compression of XML streams, especially in situations where standard TLS compression cannot be negotiated. The protocol provides a modular framework that can accommodate a wide range of compression algorithms; the ZLIB compression algorithm is mandatory-to-implement, but implementations may support other algorithms in addition.
