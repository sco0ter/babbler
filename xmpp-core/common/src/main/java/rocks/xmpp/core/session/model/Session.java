/**
 * The implementation of the {@code <session/>} element to establish a session.
 * <blockquote>
 * <p><cite><a href="https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3921.html#session">3.  Session Establishment</a></cite></p>
 * <p>If a server supports sessions, it MUST include a {@code <session/>} element qualified by the
 * 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-session' namespace in the stream features it advertises to a client after the completion
 * of stream authentication as defined in [XMPP-CORE].</p>
 * <p>Upon being so informed that session establishment is required (and after completing resource binding), the client
 * MUST establish a session if it desires to engage in instant messaging and presence functionality; it completes this
 * step by sending to the server an IQ stanza of type "set" containing an empty {@code <session/>} child element
 * qualified by the 'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-session' namespace.</p>
 * </blockquote>

 * specification</a>.</i></p>
