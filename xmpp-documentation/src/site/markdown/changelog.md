* Minor performance improvement by using a `ListIterator` in collection based result sets.
* Discover PubSub services by identity, not by feature name (it's more reliable)

* Send initial presence automatically during login (no need to do it manually anymore).
* Disabled extensions no longer process stanzas (for increased performance).
* `XmppSession` is now `XmppClient` and derives the now abstract `XmppSession`. This is due to the added support for XEP-0114.

* `login` method now returns "additional data with success", i.e. the contents of the `<success/>` element.
* Add a new `ReconnectionStrategy` implementation, which always tries to reconnect after fix time.
* There's a new "xmpp-addr" project for [RFC 6122](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6122.html) which contains the `Jid` class, which has therefore also moved to a new package (`rocks.xmpp.addr`)
* Likewise the Roster and Chat classes have been moved from the 'core' to 'im' package to better resemble the separation of RFC 6120 and 6121.
* Use [Java 8's Functional Interfaces](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/package-summary.html):
    * All event listeners have been replaced by `java.util.function.Consumer<T extends EventObject>` (if you used lambda expressions, nothing has changed for you)

    * `java.util.Date` has been replaced with `java.time.OffsetDateTime` or `java.time.Instant`
* Reduce logging overhead by deferred string building.
* XEP-0092 Software Version now responds with Babbler's version automatically.
* Stanza classes refactoring:
    * Stanzas moved from `rocks.xmpp.core.stanza.model.client` to `rocks.xmpp.core.stanza.model`. This was a necessary change for XEP-0114.
    * `Message.Body`, `Message.Subject`, `Presence.Status` classes have been replaced by a common `Text` class, since they are all the same.
    * There are new `addExtension()` / `removeExtension()` / `hasExtension()` methods.
* `XmppSession.getDomain()` returns a `Jid` instead of a `String`.
