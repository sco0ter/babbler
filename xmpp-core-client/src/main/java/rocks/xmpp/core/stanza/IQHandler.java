/**
 * Handles an inbound IQ request, (IQ stanzas of type {@link IQ.Type#GET get} or {@link IQ.Type#SET set}) by processing the request and returning an IQ response of type {@link IQ.Type#RESULT result} or {@link IQ.Type#ERROR error}.
 * <p>
 * In contrast to {@link rocks.xmpp.core.session.XmppSession#addInboundIQListener(Consumer)} which merely listens to IQ stanzas, IQ handlers facilitate the proper handling of IQ requests by enforcing the semantics of IQs, especially:
 * <blockquote>
 * <cite><a href="http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6120.html#stanzas-semantics-iq">8.2.3.  IQ Semantics</a></cite>
 * <p>An entity that receives an IQ request of type "get" or "set" MUST reply with an IQ response of type "result" or "error". The response MUST preserve the 'id' attribute of the request (or be empty if the generated stanza did not include an 'id' attribute).</p>
 * </blockquote>
 * IQ handlers are registered for a specific payload type via {@link rocks.xmpp.core.session.XmppSession#addIQHandler(Class, IQHandler)}.
