/**
 * Contains classes for <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html">XEP-0045: Multi-User Chat</a>.
 * <p>
 * It defines an XMPP protocol extension for multi-user text chat, whereby multiple XMPP users can exchange messages in the context of a room or channel, similar to Internet Relay Chat (IRC). In addition to standard chatroom features such as room topics and invitations, the protocol defines a strong room control model, including the ability to kick and ban users, to name room moderators and administrators, to require membership or passwords in order to join the room, etc.
