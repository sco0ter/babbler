/**
 * Manages the various features, which are advertised during stream negotiation.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <p><cite><a href="https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6120.html#streams-negotiation">4.3.  Stream Negotiation</a></cite></p>
 * <p>Because the receiving entity for a stream acts as a gatekeeper to the domains it services, it imposes
 * certain conditions for connecting as a client or as a peer server. At a minimum, the initiating entity needs to
 * authenticate with the receiving entity before it is allowed to send stanzas to the receiving entity (for
 * client-to-server streams this means using SASL as described under Section 6). However, the receiving entity can
 * consider conditions other than authentication to be mandatory-to-negotiate, such as encryption using TLS as described
 * under Section 5. The receiving entity informs the initiating entity about such conditions by communicating "stream
 * features": the set of particular protocol interactions that the initiating entity needs to complete before the
 * receiving entity will accept XML stanzas from the initiating entity, as well as any protocol interactions that are
 * voluntary-to-negotiate but that might improve the handling of an XML stream (e.g., establishment of application-layer
 * compression as described in [XEP-0138]).</p>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>Each feature is associated with a {@linkplain StreamFeatureNegotiator feature negotiator}, which
 * negotiates the particular feature.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class manages these negotiators, receives XML elements and delegates them to the responsible
 * feature negotiator for further processing.</p>
 *
 * <p>It negotiates the stream by sequentially negotiating each stream feature.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is thread-safe.</p>
