 * <p>It is RECOMMENDED to use Publish-Subscribe (XEP-0060) [4] for data storage, specifically through the use of personal data nodes hosted at the user's virtual publish-subscribe service as described in Best Practices for Persistent Storage of Private Data via Publish-Subscribe (XEP-0223) [5] and illustrated in the following sections.</p>
 * <p>Note: In the past, Private XML Storage (XEP-0049) [6] was the recommended method. In addition, other methods could be used, such as HTTP or WebDAV.</p>
