/**
 * Provides classes for <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0013.html">XEP-0013: Flexible Offline Message Retrieval</a>.
 * <p>
 * It defines an XMPP protocol extension for flexible, POP3-like handling of offline messages. The protocol enables a connecting client to retrieve its offline messages on login in a controlled fashion, without receiving a flood of messages. Messages can also be left on the server for later retrieval.
