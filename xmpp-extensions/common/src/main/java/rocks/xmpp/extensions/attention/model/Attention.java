/**
 * The implementation of the {@code <attention/>} element in the {@code urn:xmpp:attention:0} namespace.
 * <blockquote>
 * <p><cite><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0224.html">XEP-0224: Attention</a></cite></p>
 * <p>This feature is known as 'nudge' or 'buzz' in some non-XMPP IM protocols.</p>
 * </blockquote>
 * <h3>Listening for Attention Requests</h3>
 * <p>If you want to listen for inbound attention requests, listen for inbound messages and check if they have the {@link rocks.xmpp.extensions.attention.model.Attention} extension.
 * </p>
 * ```java
 * xmppClient.addInboundMessageListener(e -> {
 *     if (e.getMessage().hasExtension(Attention.class)) {
 *         // Handle attention request.
 *     }
 * });
 * ```java
 * <p>You should also enable this feature (preferably before login), in order to register this extension in service discovery:</p>
 * ```java
 * xmppClient.enableFeature(Attention.NAMESPACE);
 * ```
 * <h3>Requesting Attention</h3>
 * Attention requests are sent via a 'headline' message:
 * ```java
 * Message message = new Message(jid, Message.Type.HEADLINE);
 * message.addExtension(Attention.INSTANCE);
 * xmppClient.send(message);
 * ```
 * This class is immutable.
