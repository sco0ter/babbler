/**
 * The implementation of the {@code <remote-server-timeout/>} stanza error.
 * <blockquote>
 * <p><cite><a href="https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6120.html#stanzas-error-conditions-remote-server-timeout">8.3.3.17.
 * remote-server-timeout</a></cite></p>
 * <p>A remote server or service specified as part or all of the JID of the intended recipient (or needed to fulfill a
 * request) was resolved but communications could not be established within a reasonable amount of time (e.g., an XML
 * stream cannot be established at the resolved IP address and port, or an XML stream can be established but stream
 * negotiation fails because of problems with TLS, SASL, Server Dialback, etc.); the associated error type SHOULD be
 * "wait" (unless the error is of a more permanent nature, e.g., the remote server is found but it cannot be
 * authenticated or it violates security policies).</p>

 * This class is a singleton.
