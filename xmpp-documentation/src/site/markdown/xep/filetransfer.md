# File Transfer
---

Implementing file transfer in XMPP is a relative complex task, because there are so many specifications involved, if you
want to do it right.

Here's the "short" list of XEPs related to file transfer:

* [XEP-0066: Out of Band Data][Out of Band Data]
* [XEP-0047: In-Band Bytestreams][In-Band Bytestreams]
* [XEP-0065: SOCKS5 Bytestreams][SOCKS5 Bytestreams]
* [XEP-0095: Stream Initiation][Stream Initiation]
* [XEP-0096: SI File Transfer][SI File Transfer]
* [XEP-0166: Jingle][Jingle]
* [XEP-0234: Jingle File Transfer][Jingle File Transfer]
* [XEP-0260: Jingle SOCKS5 Bytestreams Transport Method][Jingle SOCKS5 Bytestreams Transport Method]
* [XEP-0261: Jingle In-Band Bytestreams Transport Method][Jingle In-Band Bytestreams Transport Method]

There are three approaches for transferring files. Let's have a closer look at them.

## The Old School Approach

First there is the old approach to just transfer files by communicating an URL to a contact, who then downloads the file
via HTTP GET. This approach is pretty simple, but inflexible and is described
in [XEP-0066: Out of Band Data][Out of Band Data].

## The Classic Approach

Next we have the [XEP-0095: Stream Initiation][Stream Initiation] and [XEP-0096: SI File Transfer][SI File Transfer]
approach, which has been around since a long time and until now is still the recommended way of doing file transfers.
Both XEPs are tightly coupled and can't really live without the other. Basically what they are doing is to communicate
the raw file information (e.g. file name, description, size, ...) and a request to accept the file over a stream method.

If accepted [XEP-0065: SOCKS5 Bytestreams][SOCKS5 Bytestreams] takes effect: The sender offers a list of stream hosts
and the receiver tries to connect to them using the SOCKS5 protocol. I everything works the file will be transferred
over the negotiated stream host.

But what if the receiver is behind a firewall and can't connect to any offered stream host?

In this case the sender transfers the file directly over the XMPP protocol (which should naturally always work) as
described in [XEP-0047: In-Band Bytestreams][In-Band Bytestreams].

This approach ensures, that the file can be transferred almost always.

## The Modern Jingle Approach

Nonetheless there's a more modern approach upcoming: [XEP-0234: Jingle File Transfer][Jingle File Transfer], which
communicates the file information and negotiates the transport method over [XEP-0166: Jingle][Jingle]. The two transport
methods are still the same, but are negotiated in the Jingle fashion
via [XEP-0260: Jingle SOCKS5 Bytestreams Transport Method][Jingle SOCKS5 Bytestreams Transport Method]
and [XEP-0261: Jingle In-Band Bytestreams Transport Method][Jingle In-Band Bytestreams Transport Method].

One of the big differences to the classic approach is that the transport method is negotiated bidirectionally. That
means if the receiver can't connect to any of the offered stream hosts, it could suggest stream hosts by itself to the
sender, which increases the chances of a successful transport negotiation.

Only if the SOCKS5 negotiation fails on both sides, the parties would fallback to In-Band Bytestreams.

## The File Transfer API

All three approaches will be abstracted behind one File Transfer API:

Note that Jingle File Transfer is not yet implemented and that the following API should still be understood as
preliminary and experimental!

### Offering a File

The following code sample will offer a file to another user. Make sure you use a full JID!

The `offerFile` method blocks until the file transfer has been accepted or rejected, but maximal 60 seconds (last
parameter).

If accepted, you can transfer the file.

```java
try {
    FileTransferManager fileTransferManager = xmppClient.getManager(FileTransferManager.class);
    FileTransfer fileTransfer = fileTransferManager.offerFile(Paths.get("test.png"), "Description", Jid.of("juliet@exampl.net/balcony"), 60000).getResult();
    fileTransfer.transfer();
} catch (FileTransferRejectedException e) {
    // The user rejected the file transfer.
} catch (XmppException e) {
    // ...
}
```

### Listening for File Transfer Offers

```java
fileTransferManager.addFileTransferOfferListener(e -> {
    try {
        FileTransfer fileTransfer = e.accept(Paths.get("test.png")).getResult();
        fileTransfer.transfer();
    } catch (IOException e1) {
        // ...
    }
});
```

### Monitoring the Progress

```java
fileTransfer.addFileTransferStatusListener(e -> {
    updateMessage(e.toString());
    updateProgress(e.getBytesTransferred(), file.length());
});
fileTransfer.transfer();
```
