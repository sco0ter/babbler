/**
 * Provides XML schema implementations of <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0177.html">XEP-0177: Jingle Raw UDP
 * Transport Method</a>.
 *
 * <p>It defines a Jingle transport method that results in sending media data using raw datagram associations via the
 * User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This simple transport method does not provide NAT traversal, and the ICE-UDP transport
 * method should be used if NAT traversal is required.</p>
