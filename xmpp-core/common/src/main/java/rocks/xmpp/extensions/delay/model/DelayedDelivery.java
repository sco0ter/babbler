 * <p>The XML namespace defined herein is used to provide timestamp information about data stored for later delivery.
 * The most common uses of this namespace are to stamp:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A message that is sent to an offline entity and stored for later delivery (see <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0160.html">Best Practices for Handling Offline Messages</a>).</li>
 * <li>The last available presence stanza sent by a connected client to a server.</li>
 * <li>Messages cached by a <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html">Multi-User Chat</a> room for delivery to new participants when they join the room.</li>
 * </ul>
