/**
 * Provides XML schema implementations of <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0071.html">XEP-0071: XHTML-IM</a>.
 *
 * <p>It defines an XHTML 1.0 Integration Set for use in exchanging instant messages that contain lightweight text
 * markup. The protocol enables an XMPP entity to format a message using a small range of commonly-used HTML elements,
 * attributes, and style properties that are suitable for use in instant messaging. The protocol also excludes HTML
 * constructs that may introduce malware and other vulnerabilities (such as scripts and objects) for improved
 * security.</p>
