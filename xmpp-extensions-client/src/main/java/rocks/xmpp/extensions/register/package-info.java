/**
 * Provides classes for <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0077.html">XEP-0077: In-Band Registration</a>.
 * <p>
 * It defines an XMPP protocol extension for in-band registration with XMPP-based instant messaging servers and other services hosted on an XMPP network (such as groupchat rooms and gateways to non-XMPP IM services). The protocol is extensible via use of data forms, thus enabling services to gather a wide range of information during the registration process. The protocol also supports in-band password changes and cancellation of an existing registration.
