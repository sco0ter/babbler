/**
 * This is the default reconnection strategy used.
 * <p>
 * It exponentially increases the time span from which a random value for the next reconnection attempt is chosen.
 * The formula for doing this, is: <code>(2<sup>n</sup> - 1) * s</code>, where <code>n</code> is the number of reconnection attempt and <code>s</code> is the slot time, which is 60 seconds by default.
 * <p>
 * In practice this means, the first reconnection attempt occurs after a random period of time between 0 and 60 seconds.<br>
 * The second attempt chooses a random number &gt;= 0 and &lt; 180 seconds.<br>
 * The third attempt chooses a random number &gt;= 0 and &lt; 420 seconds.<br>
 * The fourth attempt chooses a random number &gt;= 0 and &lt; 900 seconds.<br>
 * The fifth attempt chooses a random number &gt;= 0 and &lt; 1860 seconds (= 31 minutes)<br>
 * <p>
 * The strategy is called "truncated", because it won't increase the time span after the nth iteration, which means in the example above, the sixth and any further attempt
 * behaves equally to the fifth attempt.
 * <p>
 * This "truncated binary exponential backoff" is the <a href="https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6120.html#tcp-reconnect">recommended reconnection strategy by the XMPP specification</a>.
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable.
