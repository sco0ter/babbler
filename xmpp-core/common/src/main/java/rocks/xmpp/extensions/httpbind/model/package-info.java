/**
 * Provides XML schema implementations of <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html">XEP-0124:
 * Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH)</a> and <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0206.html">XEP-0206:
 * XMPP Over BOSH</a>.
 *
 * <p>XEP-0124 defines a transport protocol that emulates the semantics of a long-lived, bidirectional TCP connection
 * between two entities (such as a client and a server) by efficiently using multiple synchronous HTTP request/response
 * pairs without requiring the use of frequent polling or chunked responses.</p>
 *
 * <p>XEP-0206 defines how the Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH) technology can be used to transport
 * XMPP stanzas. The result is an HTTP binding for XMPP communications that is useful in situations where a device or
 * client is unable to maintain a long-lived TCP connection to an XMPP server.</p>
